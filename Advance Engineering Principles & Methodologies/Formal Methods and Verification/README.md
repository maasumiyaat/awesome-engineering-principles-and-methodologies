# Formal Methods and Verification

This directory covers mathematical approaches to software specification, verification, and validation, ensuring correctness through rigorous formal techniques.

## Overview

Formal methods apply mathematical foundations to software engineering, providing precise specifications and proofs of correctness for critical systems where failure is not acceptable.

## Key Topics

- **Formal Specification Languages**: Z, VDM, Alloy, TLA+, and other specification languages
- **Model Checking**: Automatic verification of finite-state systems
- **Theorem Proving**: Interactive proof assistants like Coq, Isabelle/HOL, Lean
- **Static Analysis**: Advanced static analysis techniques and tools
- **Program Verification**: Proving program correctness using formal methods
- **Refinement Theory**: Stepwise refinement from specifications to implementations
- **Temporal Logic**: Specifying and verifying temporal properties of systems
- **Abstract Interpretation**: Approximation techniques for program analysis
- **Contract-Based Design**: Design by contract and formal contracts
- **Verification Condition Generation**: Automated proof obligation generation
