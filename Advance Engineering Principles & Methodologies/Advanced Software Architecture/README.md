# Advanced Software Architecture

This directory covers sophisticated architectural patterns, principles, and methodologies for designing complex, scalable software systems.

## Overview

Advanced software architecture encompasses the high-level design decisions, patterns, and trade-offs involved in building enterprise-scale, distributed, and complex software systems.

## Key Topics

- **Architectural Patterns**: Advanced patterns like Event Sourcing, CQRS, Hexagonal Architecture
- **Distributed Architecture**: Microservices, service mesh, distributed system patterns
- **Scalability Patterns**: Horizontal and vertical scaling strategies
- **Resilience Patterns**: Circuit breakers, bulkheads, timeout patterns
- **Data Architecture**: Polyglot persistence, data lakes, event streaming
- **Security Architecture**: Zero-trust, defense in depth, secure by design
- **Performance Architecture**: Caching strategies, CDNs, performance optimization
- **Cloud Architecture**: Cloud-native patterns, multi-cloud strategies
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Advanced DDD concepts for complex business domains
- **Evolutionary Architecture**: Architecture that adapts to changing requirements

## Architecture Styles

- Event-driven architecture
- Layered architecture variations
- Plugin architecture
- Space-based architecture
- Pipeline architecture
- Component-based architecture

## Design Principles

- Separation of concerns at architectural level
- Loose coupling and high cohesion
- Single responsibility at component level
- Open/closed principle for extensibility
- Dependency inversion for flexibility

## Architecture Governance

- Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- Technology radar and evaluation
- Architecture review processes
- Quality attribute workshops
- Architecture compliance monitoring
