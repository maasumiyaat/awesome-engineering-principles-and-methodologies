# Distributed Systems Engineering

This directory covers the design, implementation, and operation of distributed software systems across multiple machines and networks.

## Overview

Distributed systems engineering addresses the unique challenges of building software that runs across multiple computers, dealing with network partitions, latency, consistency, and fault tolerance.

## Key Topics

- **Distributed System Models**: Synchronous vs. asynchronous, failure models
- **Consensus Algorithms**: Raft, PBFT, and other consensus mechanisms
- **Consistency Models**: Strong, eventual, causal consistency patterns
- **Fault Tolerance**: Byzantine fault tolerance, crash-stop failures
- **Replication Strategies**: Master-slave, master-master, quorum-based replication
- **Partitioning and Sharding**: Data distribution and load balancing strategies
- **Distributed Transactions**: Two-phase commit, saga patterns, distributed locking
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Event sourcing, CQRS in distributed systems
- **Service Discovery**: Dynamic service location and health checking
- **Load Balancing**: Distribution strategies and algorithms

## Theoretical Foundations

### CAP Theorem and Beyond
- Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance trade-offs
- PACELC theorem extensions
- FLP impossibility result implications

### Time and Ordering
- Logical clocks and vector clocks
- Happened-before relationships
- Global state and snapshots
- Time synchronization challenges

### Distributed Algorithms
- Leader election algorithms
- Mutual exclusion in distributed systems
- Distributed graph algorithms
- Gossip protocols and epidemic algorithms

## Practical Patterns

- Circuit breaker pattern
- Bulkhead pattern
- Timeout and retry strategies
- Backpressure handling
- Graceful degradation
- Health checks and monitoring
- Blue-green and canary deployments

## Technologies and Frameworks

- Message queues and event streaming (Kafka, RabbitMQ)
- Distributed databases (Cassandra, MongoDB, CockroachDB)
- Coordination services (Zookeeper, etcd, Consul)
- Container orchestration (Kubernetes, Docker Swarm)
- Service mesh technologies (Istio, Linkerd)
- Distributed tracing systems

## Operational Concerns

- Monitoring and observability
- Distributed debugging techniques
- Capacity planning and scaling
- Disaster recovery and backup strategies
- Security in distributed environments
- Performance optimization across networks
