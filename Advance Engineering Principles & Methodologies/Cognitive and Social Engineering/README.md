# Cognitive and Social Engineering

This directory explores the intersection of human psychology, social dynamics, and engineering practices to build better software and teams.

## Overview

Cognitive and social engineering applies insights from psychology, cognitive science, and sociology to improve software development processes, user experience, and team effectiveness.

## Key Topics

- **Cognitive Load Theory**: Managing complexity in code and user interfaces
- **Human-Computer Interaction**: Designing intuitive software interfaces
- **Team Dynamics**: Understanding and optimizing team performance
- **Behavioral Design**: Nudging users toward desired behaviors
- **Cognitive Biases**: Identifying and mitigating biases in engineering decisions
- **Social Network Analysis**: Understanding communication patterns in teams
- **Persuasive Technology**: Ethical influence through software design
- **User Psychology**: Understanding user mental models and behaviors
- **Collaborative Engineering**: Optimizing human collaboration in development
- **Emotional Intelligence**: Building empathy in engineering practices
