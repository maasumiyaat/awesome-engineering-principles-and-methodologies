# Software Metrics and Measurement

This directory covers the systematic measurement of software engineering processes, products, and outcomes to enable data-driven decision making and continuous improvement.

## Overview

Software metrics and measurement provide quantitative approaches to understanding, monitoring, and improving software development processes, product quality, and team performance through systematic data collection and analysis.

## Key Topics

- **Process Metrics**: Measuring software development processes and workflows
- **Product Metrics**: Quantifying software product characteristics and quality
- **Project Metrics**: Tracking project progress, resources, and outcomes
- **Quality Metrics**: Measuring various aspects of software quality
- **Productivity Metrics**: Assessing individual and team productivity
- **Predictive Metrics**: Using historical data to predict future outcomes
- **Goal-Question-Metric (GQM)**: Systematic approach to metrics program design
- **Measurement Theory**: Mathematical foundations of software measurement
- **Metrics Validation**: Ensuring metrics accuracy and meaningfulness
- **Benchmarking**: Comparing performance against industry standards
