# Reliability Engineering

This directory focuses on designing and maintaining software systems that operate consistently and dependably over time, emphasizing fault tolerance and system resilience.

## Overview

Reliability engineering in software systems ensures that applications and services operate correctly and consistently over extended periods, handling failures gracefully and maintaining service quality under various conditions.

## Key Topics

- **Fault Tolerance**: Designing systems that continue operating despite component failures
- **Redundancy and Replication**: Strategies for eliminating single points of failure
- **Failure Analysis**: Systematic investigation of system failures and root causes
- **Reliability Modeling**: Mathematical models for predicting and measuring reliability
- **Availability Engineering**: Ensuring systems are accessible when needed
- **Recovery and Repair**: Strategies for system restoration after failures
- **Graceful Degradation**: Maintaining partial functionality during failures
- **Chaos Engineering**: Proactive failure injection to test system resilience
- **Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)**: Google's approach to reliability at scale
- **Error Budgets**: Balancing reliability with development velocity
